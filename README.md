# Drought Prediction using Rainfall and Environmental Data

## Overview
This project predicts future drought conditions using rainfall, soil moisture, and other environmental variables. It uses machine learning models including XGBoost and LSTM.

## Folder Structure
- `data/`: Store CSV datasets here.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and modeling.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for preprocessing and training.
- `models/`: Saved models.
- `results/`: Evaluation outputs and graphs.

## Setup Instructions
1. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the notebook:
```
jupyter notebook notebooks/DroughtPrediction.ipynb
```

3. Or run the training script:
```
python scripts/train_model.py
```
